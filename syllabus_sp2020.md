- Privilege, Power and Difference (3rd Edition), by Allan G. Johnson
- The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness by Michelle Alexander

Additional course readings will be posted on Blackboard or held on reserve in the library.

## Catalog Description
(A) Freedom, justice and equality are examined in connection with racism and sexism. Fulfills: GE 11; LASR. (3 cr. hr.)

## Purpose of this course
This course will examine oppression due to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and class. Strategies of social change will be evaluated as ways to enhance freedom, justice, and equality. We will be particularly interested in how power is distributed by social groups, and how institutionalized patterns of behavior allow racism and sexism to persist.

The class will emphasize critical thinking about ethical and political problems that confront us in everyday life. It will challenge you to develop your own reflective position on selected issues, but also to sympathetically understand alternative points of view. You will be encouraged to work collaboratively in responding to class material with other students who may have differing points of view.

PHIL 140 satisfies requirements for Category 11 in the General Education program. The 2015-2016 Catalog describes GE11 as follows:
  
  The goal of this category is for students to reflect critically about the nature and
impact of prejudice and discrimination. Courses could address the individual and institutional nature of prejudice and discrimination in the American and/or global context; examine various aspects of prejudice and discrimination from multiple intellectual perspectives; examine the factors upon which prejudice and discrimination may be based, for example, race, gender as well as class, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation and disability.
  
 **Learning Outcomes**
  
  Students will demonstrate an understanding of: 
  1. issues such as power and bias as they relate to prejudice and discrimination and how these issues have determined attitudes, institutions, dominance and subdominance;
  2. how various beliefs can lead to conflicting conclusions about a society and its norms, values and institutions.

## Email Policy
If you have a general question about the course (either content or logistics), please post it on the discussion forum on Blackboard and I will answer it there (or perhaps I’ve already answered your question there, so check first before posting!). **Email me personally __only__ for personal communications** (e.g., needing to be excused from class, needing special accommodations, questions about grades, etc.). This email policy will be strictly enforced, so if you would like a prompt response to your questions please follow the above protocol. This email policy is necessary to save my sanity — I have a significant number of students most semesters, so having all general information queries posted to Blackboard helps make it so I don’t have to answer the same question multiple times.  For all Blackboard posts or emails sent after 5 PM, allow until 1 PM the next day for a response. Response times may be longer on weekends, with the possibility that I may not be able to answer your Blackboard post or email until Monday after my classes.

Electronic Devices
Laptop computers or tablet-style computers or e-readers are permitted in class for class purposes only (taking notes, accessing class texts, etc.). Cell phones are to be off or on silent, and I ask that you refrain from checking your phone during class unless you are an emergency contact for someone (please inform me if that is the case). Any student using an electronic device in an inappropriate manner will be asked to put the device away. Students who are repeat offenders may lose their electronic device privileges (at the discretion of the instructor).

Grading Schema
Grades in this course will be represented on a 12 point scale. The point/grade scale for all of the course components will be as follows:



When assigning the final grade at the end of the semester, decimals will be rounded up if  .5 or higher (e.g., a final weighted average of 9.5 would be rounded up to a 10, which would be an A-), and rounded down if .49 or lower (e.g., a final weighted average of 9.49 would be rounded down to a 9, which would be an B+). Since we no longer have a final grade of A+, all grades 10.5 or higher will count as an A for the purposes of assigning a final grade.

Coursework
Your grade in the course will depend on your performance on the following course components: class participation, weekly reading quizzes, weekly discussion posts, movie reflection paper, campus engagement paper, privilege investigations paper, philosophical book review and four exams (three during the course of the semester and one during finals week). These elements will account for the following fractions of your grade:

Class Participation: 15%			Weekly Discussion Posts: 15%
Weekly Reading Quizzes: 10%		Papers: 30%	
Exams: 30%

All of these course components are explained below in some depth, so that you will know what is expected of you.

Attendance (affects Participation)
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class, although it does not directly contribute to your grade. It is highly recommended that you attend class on a regular basis. One of the components you are being graded on is class participation, and you cannot participate if you are not in class, so frequent non-attendance will hurt your participation grade. Missed classes will count as unexcused unless proper notification is given in a timely fashion (see below for expected timeline for different types of absences):


Things that count as excused absences:
School-related sports absences or other school-related trips (debate club, field trips for other classes, etc.): please give notice of all necessary absences as soon as possible (ideally within the first two weeks of class). You will need to provide an official sports excuse before our absence (you may deliver it to my mailbox in the philosophy department if you not have it in time to give it to me in class before your absence). For other school-related trips other than sports events, please provide some other appropriate form of documentation (if you are unsure what will count as appropriate documentation for your event please discuss it with me sufficiently in advance of the event, but generally an email from the faculty member organizing the event will suffice).
Religious holidays: these are well-documented events and thus should not come as a surprise, either to you or your instructor. If you will need to be absent for any religious holidays over the course of the semester please inform the instructor at least a week in advance, by email.
Illness: If you need to miss class because you are ill, please inform the instructor of this via email before the start of class. No documentation or gory details are necessary, please. Important note: mental illness and mental health crises are no different from physical illness, and deserve the same consideration. Again, no documentation or sensitive details are necessary, unless this is going to be an on-going situation for which special accommodations will need to be made.
Other emergency situations (family emergencies, personal crisis, etc.) on a case-by-case basis – please give as much notice as is possible in these circumstances, and keep in touch if this is going to be an on-going situation.

Note: coming late to class or leaving early counts as an unexcused absence, unless you speak to the instructor about your need to do so (preferably by email before class) and receive the instructor's okay to come late/leave early. Sleeping in class also counts as being absent for the purposes of participation (you can’t participate if you are sleeping!)

Policy on Children in Class
Currently, the university does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy laid out in this syllabus is a reflection of my own beliefs and commitment to students who are also parents.
All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary, and breastfeeding in class will be considered to be normal and unproblematic.
For older children and babies, I understand that unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to miss class to stay home with a child. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in childcare is perfectly acceptable.
I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status.
In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met.
Finally, I understand that the largest barrier to completing your coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. While I maintain the same high expectations for all students in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy to problem-solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you strive for school/parenting balance.
 
Class Participation (15%)
Class participation is essential to the learning objectives in this class. It is only by talking through through the ideas and concepts in this class together that we can each come to an informed, reflective stance on the difficult and important issues that we will be dealing with in this class. One of the important learning objectives in this class is to learn to actively listen to and engage with ideas and points of view that may differ from our own, and to learn how to respectfully engage in constructive dialogue with those holding these differing points of view. This can only be learned through practice! Thus, much of class time will be devoted to class discussion, both with the class as a whole and in small groups, and it is essential that you fully participate in all class discussions. (Note: you cannot fully participate if you have not done the reading(s) for that week!)

However, I also recognize that this is not always possible. We all have days when we don't feel like talking, or when we've simply been too busy with work from our other classes, and thus have not been able to do the work necessary to be able to participate fully in the class discussions for that day. Additionally, I also recognize that there will occasionally be days when you need to miss class for reasons not covered by the above attendance policy. In light of this, I will be dropping your two lowest participation grades at the end of the semester (thus giving you two days in which your non-participation will not count against you). However, you only get two of these “free passes” so use them wisely!

Participation points will be assigned for each class, according to the following scale:


Daily participation grades will be averaged and then normalized to a 12 pt scale (see the discussion of the grading schema for the class above) at the end of the semester. Your current participation average will be posted with your grades on Blackboard (updated ~once a week) so that you know where you stand participation-wise throughout the semester.

Weekly Reading Quiz (10%)
Since the bulk of our in-class time will be spent discussing, clarifying, and critiquing the texts for this class, it is essential for you to read these texts on your own, before the beginning of the week. The weekly reading quizzes are intended to encourage you to keep up with the reading and to test your comprehension of those readings. Each assignment will be reasonably short (12 questions), and will consist of multiple choice, T/F, matching or fill-in-the-blank questions. 

There will be a quiz for the readings for every week starting in Week 2 (due Monday mornings at 8 AM) that will be taken on Blackboard (open-book). The quizzes are timed (15 min.), so it is essential that you do the readings for that week before you start the reading quiz for that week (although the quiz is open-book, you will simply not be able to look everything up as you go along in working through the quiz – there just isn't time for that, by design). Your 10 best quiz scores will be used to calculate your final grade.

Weekly Discussion Posts (15%)
One of the things I want you to become aware of during the course of this semester (if you aren't already) is that the –isms (racism, sexism, heterosexism, ageism, ableism, etc.) are things that are still (unfortunately) very present in today's society. To that end, I will ask you all to be monitoring news and social media on an on-going basis during the semester, and to bring one such news item to the class every week. There will be a discussion thread for each week of the class after the first week, and it will be your responsibility to post a news story to the discussion board for 10 out of the 13 weeks (you choose which weeks you want to post a story). For each week, your original post must be posted by 5 PM on Monday in order to receive credit. In your post you will provide a short introduction to the news story (what is it about, why it is relevant to the class, etc.), along with stating your own position on the story. You will also need to provide a link (make the link a hot link – see the online tutorial on making hot links on Blackboard if you don't know how) to the news story online. 

I have two goals for the weekly discussion posts: 
To help make you aware of the racism, sexism, heterosexism, ageism, ableism, etc. that is going on around us, all the time (unfortunately).
To give people a safe space to engage in the necessary and sometimes difficult process of talking through our honest disagreements and questions about these difficult issues.

Your original posts will help us achieve the first goal, but it is in your responses to each other’s original posts, and the conversation that follows from that response that the second goal will be realized. You will have until Friday at 5 PM to engage in this dialogue together. Any posts made after 5 PM on Fridays will not count for the purposes of the extra credit for the Discussions. After 5 PM on Fridays I will decide which thread (or threads!) generated the most interesting and meaningful discussions that took place that week (note: I also reserve the right to decide that no threads reached an appropriate threshold for any given week). Everyone who makes a meaningful contribution to any of the thread(s) that I select will receive 1 pt. extra credit for that week’s discussion.

How do you make a meaningful contribution to a discussion thread?  There are various ways you can do this: you can ask a (meaningful) question about the original post, disagree (respectfully) with the original poster’s position on the story, post another news story that adds on to the context of the original story or which presents the same story from a different point of view (make sure the link to the new story is also a hot link), or in some way add to the conversation at hand. What I don’t want to see are “me too” responses — responses that just echo the original poster’s point of view on the story, without adding anything of value to the discussion. Responses that do not fit the category of a meaningful response will not receive the extra credit.

Papers (30%)
There are four papers for this class: the Movie Reflections Paper, the Book Reflections Paper, the Privilege Investigations Paper, and the Campus Engagement Paper. The papers in total count for 30% of your grade, and I will be dropping your lowest paper grade at the end of the semester (thus, your eventual grade for this portion of the course will be based on your grade on 3 out of the 4 papers). 

Movie Reflection Paper
Another of my goals for this class is to help you see what the world looks like from different perspectives, ones that may differ from your own life experiences in meaningful ways. Additionally, this class may also help you put some of your own life experiences in perspective, by seeing how other people may have had similar experiences (letting you know that you are not alone, and giving you a greater context for your own experiences). The Cortland library has an extensive library of movies that deal with topics relevant to this class, and which can allow you to see what life is like from a different perspective. I will be posting a list of movies that you can chose from in order to write your movie reflection paper. You will watch one of these movies and then write a short paper on  reflecting on the movie. Papers should be 500-750 words in length, typed and double spaced, in which you reflect on the movie and your response to it. I am not looking for simply a summary of the movie — what I am interested in are your reactions to the movie. Recall that the goal for this exercise is to help you experience life from a different perspective from your own (alternatively, to give a greater context to your own experiences), so what I am interested in hearing about in this assignment is what you learned about other people and their experiences through watching this movie, and how you feel about what you learned.

You may choose whenever is convenient for you during the course of the semester to watch one of these movies, and then submit your paper. My recommendation is to get it done early in the semester, while your workload is lighter than it will be later in the semester, but the choice is up to you. The last possible date to submit the Movie Reflections paper is 5 PM on the last day of classes (Friday, May 8). Your paper should be double-spaced with a size 14 font of a legible type (no cursive fonts!). Format your paper for blind grading by not putting your name anywhere on your paper or in your file name. 

Don’t like the grade you received on your Movie Reflections paper? You are permitted to write a second paper (on a different movie!), and I will take the highest grade of the two papers as your final grade for this assignment. However, you will not be able to take advantage of this opportunity if you wait until the last second, so this is another reason to complete this assignment early in the semester!

Note: it is not possible to write a paper about one of the movies that you are required to watch for the class (one that is assigned as part of your class readings). Also, if you wish to write a Movie Reflections paper about a movie that is not in the folder on the Movie Reflections paper page on Blackboard, you need to clear the movie with me before submitting a paper.

Book Reflections Paper
I will also be asking you to read one book that relates to the topics in this class and write a short reflective paper about the book. Like with the Movie Reflections Paper, the goals for this paper are to help you see what the world looks like from different perspectives, ones that may differ from your own life experiences in meaningful ways, or to give you a larger context for your own experiences. I will be posting a list of books that you can chose from in order to write your book reflection paper, some of which are available through the Cortland library (others you may need to purchase for a relatively cheap price). You will read one of these books and then write a short paper on  reflecting on the book. Papers should be 500-750 words in length, typed and double spaced, in which you reflect on the book and your response to it. I am not looking for simply a summary of the book — what I am interested in are your reactions to the book. Recall that the goal for this exercise is to help you experience life from a different perspective from your own (alternatively, to give a greater context to your own experiences), so what I am interested in hearing about in this assignment is what you learned about other people and their experiences through reading this book, and how you feel about what you learned.

You may choose whenever is convenient for you during the course of the semester to read one of these books, and then submit your paper. My recommendation is to get it done early in the semester, while your workload is lighter than it will be later in the semester, but the choice is up to you. The last possible date to submit the Book Reflections paper is 5 PM on the last day of classes (Friday, May 8). Your paper should be double-spaced with a size 14 font of a legible type (no cursive fonts!). Format your paper for blind grading by not putting your name anywhere on your paper or in your file name.

Don’t like the grade you received on your Book Reflections paper? You are permitted to write a second paper (on a different book!), and I will take the highest grade of the two papers as your final grade for this assignment. However, you will not be able to take advantage of this opportunity if you wait until the last second, so this is another reason to complete this assignment early in the semester!

Privilege Investigations Paper
One of the issues you will learn about in this class is the issue of different types of privilege that some people have — white privilege, male privilege, heterosexual privilege, able-bodied privilege, etc.  I have created a couple of different exercises that will help you investigate different types of privilege and how they are enacted in our society. You will pick one of these exercises to complete (should take you ~1 hour to complete each exercise) and then you will write a short paper reflecting on the exercise. Papers should be 500-750 words in length, typed and double spaced, in which you reflect on the exercise and your response to it (note: this paper tends to require a word count on the higher end of this range in order to do the topic justice!). Again, I am not interested in simply a summary of what you discovered by doing the exercise — what I am interested in are your reactions to the exercise. What did you learn by doing this exercise that was new or surprising to you? What did this exercise make you think about, that you never thought about before? How did this exercise make you feel? etc. In short, I am looking to find out what you got out of completing this exercise.

You may choose whenever is convenient for you during the course of the semester to complete this exercise, and then submit your paper. My recommendation is to get it done early in the semester, while your workload is lighter than it will be later in the semester, but the choice is up to you. The last possible date to submit the Privilege Investigations paper is 5 PM on the last day of classes (Friday, May 8). Your paper should be double-spaced with a size 14 font of a legible type (no cursive fonts!). Format your paper for blind grading by not putting your name anywhere on your paper or in your file name.

Don’t like the grade you received on your Privilege Investigations paper? You are permitted to write a second paper (about a different assignment!), and I will take the highest grade of the two papers as your final grade for this assignment. However, you will not be able to take advantage of this opportunity if you wait until the last second, so this is another reason to complete this assignment early in the semester!

Campus Engagement Paper
On a regular basis faculty and class members will announce events happening on campus or in the community (speakers, workshops, rallies, etc.) which examine or attempt to address sexism, racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, etc.  You will attend at least one such event and write a short paper on the event within one week after you attend the event. Papers should be 500-750 words in length, typed and double spaced, in which you reflect on the event and your response to it. Again, I am not interested in a summary of what happened at the event — what I am interested in are your reactions to the event. What did you learn at the event that was new or surprising to you? What did this event make you think about, that you never thought about before? How did this event make you feel? etc. In short, I am looking to find out what you got out of attending this event.

You may choose whenever is convenient for you during the course of the semester to attend one of these events, and then submit your paper. My recommendation is to get it done early in the semester, while your workload is lighter than it will be later in the semester, but the choice is up to you. The last possible date to submit the Campus Engagement paper is 5 PM on the last day of classes (Friday, May 8). Your paper should be double-spaced with a size 14 font of a legible type (no cursive fonts!). Format your paper for blind grading by not putting your name anywhere on your paper or in your file name.

Don’t like the grade you received on your Campus Engagement paper? You are permitted to write a second paper (about a different event!), and I will take the highest grade of the two papers as your final grade for this assignment. However, you will not be able to take advantage of this opportunity if you wait until the last second, so this is another reason to complete this assignment early in the semester!

Exams (30%)
There will be four exams for the course, three during the course of the class and one during finals week (see Course Schedule for due dates). Each exam will be a take-home exam and will consist of a series of short and long essay questions. Each exam will primarily focus on the material covered since the last exam but I reserve the right to ask questions about material from earlier in the course at my discretion. Each exam will be available as soon as the previous exam is over. Students must submit their exams online through SafeAssignment. Your exam responses should be double-spaced with a size 14 font of a legible type (no cursive fonts!) and citations should follow either APA or Chicago style (no MLA under any circumstances!). Format your responses for blind grading by not putting your name anywhere on your responses or in your file name. Your best three exam grades (out of four) will count towards your final grade.

Lateness policies
Late weekly reading quizzes will not be accepted without prior approval from the instructor (email the instructor for an extension before the deadline — extensions on reading quizzes will only be granted in extreme circumstances, since you will have at least a week to complete the quiz before the due date so in general you should be able to plan around any other commitments in order to complete the quiz by the due date). However, you may miss two of these assignments without penalty (I take the best 10 quizzes out of 12 when calculating your final grade).

Late discussion posts or responses will not be counted. Initial posts are counted as late if not posted before Monday at 5 PM in the week they are due, and responses to other people’s posts will not be counted if not posted before Friday at 5 PM of the same week. However, you only need to create an original post for 10 out of the 13 weeks, so if you miss a discussion this will not unduly affect your grade.

Late exams will not be accepted without prior approval from the instructor (email the instructor for an extension before the deadline — extensions on exams will only be granted in extreme circumstances, since you will have several weeks to complete the exam before the due date so in general you should be able to plan around any other commitments in order to complete the exam by the due date). If not, missing one exam should not hurt you overly much, since I will be using the best three out four scores to determine your final exam grade.

Campus Engagement papers are due no later than 1 calendar week after the event. The last possible date/time to submit a Campus Engagement paper is the last day of class (Friday, May 8) at 5 PM.

There are no due dates for the Movie Reflection paper, so the discussion of whether or not late papers will be accepted is not relevant. However, it is relevant to note that the last possible date/time to submit a Movie Reflection paper is the last day of class (Friday, May 8) at 5 PM.

Likewise, there are no due dates for the Book Reflections paper or the Privilege Investigations paper, so the discussion of whether or not late papers will be accepted is not relevant. However, it is relevant to note that the last possible date/time to submit a Book Reflections paper or Privilege Investigations paper is the last day of class (Friday, May 8) at 5 PM.


Diversity Statement
SUNY Cortland is dedicated to the premise that every individual is important in a unique way and contributes to the overall quality of the institution. We define diversity broadly to include all aspects of human difference. The College is committed to inclusion, equity, and access and thus committed to creating and sustaining a climate that is equitable, respectful and free from prejudice for students, faculty and staff. We value diversity in the learning environment and know that it enhances our ability to inspire students to learn, lead and serve in a changing world. We are committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive campus through the recruitment and retention of faculty, staff and students. As a community, we hold important the democracy of ideas, tempered by a commitment to free speech and the standards of inquiry and debate. To this end, we are dedicated to developing and sustaining a learning environment where it is safe to explore our differences and celebrate the richness inherent in our pluralistic society. (College Handbook, Chapter 130)

Inclusive Learning Environment Statement

SUNY Cortland is committed to a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment. The course instructor honors this commitment and respects and values differences. All students enrolled in this course are expected to be considerate of others, promote a collaborative and supportive educational environment, and demonstrate respect for individuals with regard to ability or disability, age, ethnicity, gender, gender identity/expression, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status or other aspects of identity. In an environment that fosters inclusion, students have the opportunity to bring their various identities into conversation as they find helpful, but are not expected to represent or speak for an entire group of people who share aspects of an identity. If you have any questions or concerns about this statement, contact the Institutional Equity and Inclusion Office at 607-753-2263.” (IEIO http://www2.cortland.edu/about/diversity/)


Title IX Statement
Title IX, when combined with New York Human Rights Law and the New York Education Law 129-B, prohibits discrimination, harassment and violence based on sex, gender, gender identity/expression, and/or sexual orientation in the education setting. The federal Clery Act and NY Education Law 129-B provide certain rights and responsibilities after an incident of sexual or interpersonal violence. When a violation occurs, victims and survivors are eligible for campus and community resources. Where the College has jurisdiction, it may investigate and take action in accordance with College policy. If you or someone you know wishes to report discrimination based in sex, gender, gender identity/expression, and/or sexual orientation, or wishes to report sexual harassment, sexual violence, stalking or relationship violence, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at 607-753-4550, or visit cortland.edu/titleix to learn about all reporting options and resources. (Updated by SUNY Legal Feb. 1, 2018). (Title IX http://www2.cortland.edu/titleix)

Accommodations 
As part of SUNY Cortland’s commitment to a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment, we strive to provide students with equal access to all courses. If you believe you will require accommodations in this course, please place a request with the Disability Resources Office at disability.resources@cortland.edu or call 607-753-2967. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Disability Resources Office is important. All students should consider meeting with their course instructor who may be helpful in other ways. (College Handbook, Chapter 745)

Academic Honesty
All students are expected to uphold academic integrity standards. Plagiarism is defined as taking the ideas of others and using them as one's own without due credit. Students who cheat in examinations, course assignments, or plagiarize in this course may be disciplined in accordance with university rules and regulations. (College Handbook, Chapter 340). If you have any questions about what constitutes academic honesty or dishonesty, you are responsible for speaking to me about them.  ("But I didn’t know that was cheating" will not excuse instances of cheating.) The minimum penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a zero on that assignment or exam.

Barriers to Success
Students often experience barriers to the successful completion of their courses because of issues with personal or family issues, financial stresses, adjustments to college life and independent living, as well as other reasons. In designing this course I have tried to build in fail-safes for most of the foreseeable issues, and have tried not to create any additional barriers to student success. However, it is impossible to anticipate all of the issues that might get in the way of student success. If you are experiencing issues that are creating barriers to your success in this course please visit me during my office hours to discuss this with me. I will do my best to work with you in order to create a path towards academic success, but I can only do so if you let me know what is going on! All such discussions will be held in the strictest confidence and will not affect my views of you or your work in this class.

Student Support Services
If you are experiencing undue personal or academic stress at any time during the semester or need to talk with someone about a personal problem or situation, I encourage you to seek support as soon as possible. I am available to talk with you about stresses related to or affecting your work in my class at any time.
