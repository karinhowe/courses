# Introduction to the Course 

This course will examine oppression due to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and class. Strategies of social change will be evaluated as ways to enhance freedom, justice, and equality. We will be particularly interested in how power is distributed by social groups, and how institutionalized patterns of behavior allow racism and sexism to persist. The class will emphasize critical thinking about ethical and political problems that confront us in everyday life. It will challenge you to develop your own reflective position on selected issues, but also to sympathetically understand alternative points of view. You will be encouraged to work collaboratively in responding to class material with other students who may have differing points of view. PHIL 140 satisfies requirements for Category 11 in the General Education program at SUNY Cortland. The 2015-2016 Catalog describes GE11 as follows: The goal of this category is for students to reflect critically about the nature and impact of prejudice and discrimination. Courses could address the individual and institutional nature of prejudice and discrimination in the American and/or global context; examine various aspects of prejudice and discrimination from multiple intellectual perspectives; examine the factors upon which prejudice and discrimination may be based, for example, race, gender as well as class, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation and disability. 

## Learning Outcomes
Students will demonstrate an understanding of: 
1. issues such as power and bias as they relate to prejudice and discrimination and how these issues have determined attitudes, institutions, dominance and subdominance; 
2. how various beliefs can lead to conflicting conclusions about a society and its norms, values and institutions.
