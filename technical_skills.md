# Technical Skills Needed for the Course 

You will need a certain level of "tech savy" in order to be successful in the course. Don't worry if you don't know how to do all of these things from the get-go -- I will provide you with instructions and tutorials for how to do everything (to the best of my ability), and I'm always available for help where needed! However. It is YOUR responsibility to immediately address any technological problems you may have in this course, and to plan ahead for any technological failures. **Technological problems suffice as an excuse for not submitting work on time and in the approved fashion only in very exigent circumstances.**

**Access to hi-speed internet is mandatory for this course.**

## Logging in to Blackboard 

All lectures, quizzes, Blackboard discussions, papers and some of the readings will be posted on Blackboard. Therefore, the use of Blackboard is an integral component of this course. To login in to the Blackboard for the course: 
1. Go to [myRedDragon](https://cortland.sharepoint.com/sites/mrd?wa=wsignin1.0) 
2. Enter your UserID and password in the spaces provided. 

Need help logging in? Contact the The Help Center at (607) 753-2500, email THC@cortland.edu or visit The Help Center in the library (main circulation desk)

## Making a Word Processing Document into a PDF 

Because not everyone uses the same word-processing programs, it can be a good idea to convert your documents into PDFs before uploading them to Blackboard. 
- This is EASY on a Mac. Select **Command-P**. When the print screen comes up you will see a button in the lower lefthand corner that says "PDF." Click on that button to get the drop-down menu. Select "Save as PDF" and save the resulting PDF to the desired location. 
- Making documents into a PDF on an Windows machine seems to be similar. In some applications you will be able to simply save your document as a PDF (look for a "Save to PDF" option under your file Menu). Otherwise what you will do is Print to PDF using a PDF driver (if you don't already have one installed, [here is a link to a webpage](http://www.wikihow.com/Create-PDF-Files-from-Any-Windows-Application) that talks about how to get one, install it, and use it). 

## Making a Screenshot 

Knowing how to make a screenshot will also be a very useful tool in this class. For example, you might need to use a screenshot to take an image of a completed quiz or exercise on your computer in order to upload it to one of our weekly quizzes. Also, being able to take screenshots can be very helpful as a way to trouble-shoot any technical problems you may be having with the course -- you can then share that screenshot with other people so that they can see what's going on, and hopefully help you out. If you don't already know how to make a screenshot on your computer, here's how: 
- This is EASY on a Mac. Simply press **Command-Shift-4**, then select an area: Take a screenshot of the area and save it as a file on the desktop (on my Mac it gets saved under a name something like "Screen shot <date> at <time>"). This will be a .png file, which is fine, or you can open it in Preview (comes with the Mac OS) and resave in one of the other image file formats (.jpeg, .gif). 
- Taking screenshots on an Windows machine seems to be harder. Here is my best understanding of how to do it (sorry, I'm not a Windows user): 
  - Press **Alt-Print Screen** to copy the active window or document (copies the whole window - bleh). 
  - Open MS Paint (comes with Windows) and paste in the screenshot you just made. 
  - Crop the image until it contains just the part of the screenshot you need. 
  - Save as some kind of image file (.jpg, .gif, .png). 

## Posting on the Discussion Board on Blackboard 

Like most philosophy courses, this course is extensively discussion-based. You will need to contribute an original post and respond to other people's discussion posts every week. Additionally, we will be making use of the discussion board on Blackboard as one of the ways we can communicate with each other. If you have any questions about the course (logistics, nuts & bolts, content, etc.) that another classmate might legitimately also want to know the answer to, you should post it on the discussion board on Blackboard. For all other questions (e.g., questions about grades, personal issues, requests for a Skype meeting, etc.), email me directly via the email link on Blackboard. 
- [[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blackboard/help/student_help/discussions.html|Tutorial: Discussion Forums]] [viewing time: 2:42 min.] 
- The video tutorial also does not discuss subscriptions to the Discussion Boards. Subscribing to a thread within the forum, will let you know immediately when your question has been answered. To subscribe to a thread, click the "Subscribe" button at the top lefthand side of the page when you are in the thread. Once you have subscribed to one of the threads on the discussion board you will then receive an email whenever someone posts in anything in that thread. If you no longer wish to receive such emails, simply go back to the discussion forum and click the button again (it will now say "Unsubscribe") to unsubscribe to the thread. 

## Making Links "Hot" on Blackboard

When you post a link on Blackboard (e.g., in the Discussion Board), you need to make that link "hot" (clickable). The following tutorial shows how to do this:

## Using the HTML Function on Blackboard

It can be good idea to use the "HTML" function on Blackboard when copying and pasting text from a word processing document into Blackboard. This is especially true if you are using Microsoft Word as your word processing document, because Word also makes html documents, so it has a lot of html code that comes along for the ride when you copy-and-paste from it (except it's super crappy html code). This can really mess up your Blackboard posts, so this video will explain how to avoid that by using the HTML function in Blackboard:

## Uploading a Profile Picture to Blackboard

I would like everyone to have a profile picture on Blackboard. That way as you are posting on the discussion board or whatever, people will be able to see who is doing the posting! The following video explains how to upload a profile picture on Blackboard, since it's not necessarily intuitive.

## Visiting Office Hours via Zoom 

Office hours will take place for this class on campus (times/days posted on Blackboard). However, if you need to meet with me outside of those designated times, the meeting will likely need to take place online via Zoom (since I live in Syracuse, which is ~45 min. from campus, I need to limit my trips to campus on other days). Zoom is free to download on all operating systems: [download Zoom here](https://zoom.us/download). Zoom is a free video conferencing application that you can download for free for all operating systems and devices (except maybe Linux?). You will need speakers and a microphone on your device to make this work. For best quality sound it is suggested that you use an external microphone and speakers on your device, but I use the internal microphone and speakers on my laptop and it seems to work just fine. 

How to connect with me via Zoom 
1. [Sign up for a Zoom account](https://zoom.us). 
2. [Download the Zoom application for the device of your choice](https://zoom.us/support/download). Zoom is also available in the Apple App store (search for "zoom") or on Google Play (search for "zoom") for Android devices. 
3. To meet during a pre-arranged time (contact me via email to arrange this), just click on the link on Blackboard (under "Office Hours")!
